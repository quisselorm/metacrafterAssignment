# Project Name
**quisscoin**

## Description
This project is a Solidity smart contract for the creation and management of a simple cryptocurrency token called "quisscoin" with the symbol "qc."

The contract provides basic functionality for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens, as well as tracking user balances. 

It serves as a foundational example for creating Ethereum-based tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Solidity Compiler](https://soliditylang.org/): Make sure you have a compatible version (e.g., Solidity 0.8.18) installed to compile the smart contract.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.

3. Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum testnet or the Ethereum mainnet, as per your requirements.

## Executing

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using Ethereum wallet applications, libraries, or development frameworks.

You can mint new quisscoins and burn them using the provided functions, and you can check user balances and the total supply.
